<h2>Policies</h2>
<p>Policies are used by Okta to control rules and settings that govern, among other things, user session lifetime, whether multifactor authentication is required when logging in, what MFA factors may be employed, password complexity requirements, what types of self-service operations are permitted under various circumstances, and what Identity Provider to route users to.</p>
